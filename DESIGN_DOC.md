## Implementation Notes

### Customization Approach
**Template Customization:** The base Payload CMS template includes many generic/cookie-cutter elements that won't be needed for this salon website. We will:
- **Remove unused blocks/components** - Only keep what's needed for Dynamic Stylz Salon
- **Customize existing blocks** - Modify to match salon-specific needs (services, pricing, reviews)
- **Build custom components** - Create salon-specific components (team profiles, service cards with pricing, review displays)
- **Simplify structure** - Focus on essential pages and features, remove unnecessary complexity
- **Client-editable only** - Only elements that need to be changed by the client will be editable in CMS; static elements (like site structure, design system) will be hardcoded

**What stays:** Core CMS functionality, essential blocks needed for salon content, admin interface
**What goes:** Generic blog features (unless needed), unnecessary blocks, template demo content, unused components

### Pricing System
- **Fixed-price services:** CMS field for price (e.g., "Men's Cut: $25")
- **Custom services:** Checkbox or field to mark "Call for consultation"
- **Display logic:** Show price if available, otherwise show "Call for consultation"
- Easy to update prices in admin panel

### Reviews Display Strategy
- **Image Reviews (Priority):**
  - Large, prominent display
  - Show review image, text, and rating
  - Featured placement on homepage and services pages
  
- **Text Reviews (Collage):**
  - Grid or masonry layout
  - Smaller cards with text and rating
  - Can include more reviews without overwhelming
  
- **Flexible CMS:** Admin can control which reviews are featured, order, and display style

### Tone & Voice Guidelines
- **Casual & friendly** - Like talking to a neighbor
- **Small-town appeal** - Relatable, down-to-earth
- **Professional but approachable** - Expert without being intimidating
- **Warm & welcoming** - Makes everyone feel at home
- **Avoid:** Corporate jargon, overly formal language, pretentious tone
